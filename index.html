      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
       I am a high school senior ranked in the top 3% of my class with a 4.0 GPA. I have completed programming and computer science courses, as well as AP classes such as biology, U.S. history, and english language and composition. I am currently taking AP pre-calculus, macroeconomics, and english literature and composition.

      <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
      <p>
        At the young age of three years, I began exploring technology through learning apps. and it quickly became a part of my everyday life. As I grew older, I noticed how essential technology became essential: not just for entertainment or education, but for how people live, work, and connect. I knew early on I wanted a future in the tech-world -- I just wasn't exactly sure where I would fit in. <br>
        It wasn't until I started exploring programming and computer science that everything finally clicked. The problem-solving, logic, and creativity involved in coding, as well as the captivating complexity of technology, made it clear that this it the path I want to follow. Through classes, projects, and hands-on experience, I’ve found a deep passion for computer science -- and I’m excited to keep learning and building in this ever-evolving field.
